## Current System Behavior - Phase 1

### What Works:
- GUI loads with all input fields and buttons
- Parking lot creation with valid inputs
- Basic form rendering

# Anti-Patterns Identification - Phase 1

## Summary of Anti-Patterns Found:

1. **No Input Validation** - Crashes when converting empty strings to int
2. **Inheritance Bugs** - ElectricVehicle classes don't properly inherit  
3. **Poor Error Handling** - Unhelpful error messages
4. **God Class** - ParkingManager does everything

## Detailed Analysis:

### 1. No Input Validation
**Evidence:** Screenshot `002_error_input_validation_empty_fields.png`

**Problem:** 
- Code attempts `int("")` without validation at `ParkingManager.py:279`
- Application crashes with technical error message instead of user-friendly guidance
- Poor user experience - no indication of required fields

**Impact:** Users encounter crashes instead of helpful validation messages

### 2. Inheritance Bugs  
**Evidence:** Code analysis of `ElectricVehicle.py`

**Problem:**
- `ElectricCar` and `ElectricBike` classes don't properly inherit from `ElectricVehicle`
- Missing `ElectricVehicle(Vehicle)` inheritance chain
- Results in `TypeError` when trying to use EV functionality

**Impact:** Electric vehicle functionality is completely broken

### 3. Poor Error Handling
**Evidence:** Various error messages throughout application

**Problem:**
- Technical stack traces shown to end users
- No graceful error recovery
- Misleading messages like "parking lot full" when lot is empty

**Impact:** Confusing user experience and difficult debugging

### 4. God Class Anti-Pattern
**Evidence:** `ParkingManager.py` (400+ lines)

**Problem:**
- Single class handles GUI, business logic, data management, and vehicle operations
- Violates Single Responsibility Principle
- Difficult to test, maintain, and extend

**Impact:** Poor code organization and scalability limitations

### Test Results:
- ✅ Parking lot creation: WORKS with valid inputs
- ⚠️ Vehicle parking: TO BE TESTED
- ⚠️ EV functionality: LIKELY BROKEN due to inheritance

### 5. Poor User Feedback System

**Evidence:** 
- Both regular and EV vehicles show identical "Allocated slot number: 1" messages
- Confirmation messages break table formatting and appear inline with data cells
- Console outputs accumulate without clearing, creating visual clutter
- Multiple "Vehicles" headers repeat in status displays

**Problems:**
- Identical slot numbering for different slot types (regular vs EV) causes confusion
- Success messages disrupt table layout and are difficult to read
- No separation between operational messages and data presentation
- Historical outputs stack up, obscuring current system state
- Missing clear empty state indicators

**Impact:** 
- Users may miss critical confirmation messages due to poor visual placement
- Difficult to distinguish current parking lot status from historical data
- Poor information architecture leads to user confusion and potential errors
- Unprofessional user experience that undermines user confidence

**What Good Design Would Do:**
- Separate confirmation messages from data tables using dedicated message areas
- Provide clear visual distinction between different types of information
- Implement consistent message placement following established UX patterns
- Clear console between major operations to maintain focus on current state
- Design clean empty states with clear "No vehicles parked" messaging
- Use distinct slot numbering systems (REG-1 vs EV-1) to avoid ambiguity
