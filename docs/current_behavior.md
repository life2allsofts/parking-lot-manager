## Current System Behavior - Phase 1

### What Works:
- GUI loads with all input fields and buttons
- Parking lot creation with valid inputs
- Basic form rendering

# Anti-Patterns Identification - Phase 1

## Summary of Anti-Patterns Found:

1. **No Input Validation** - Crashes when converting empty strings to int
2. **Inheritance Bugs** - ElectricVehicle classes don't properly inherit  
3. **Poor Error Handling** - Unhelpful error messages
4. **God Class** - ParkingManager does everything

## Detailed Analysis:

### 1. No Input Validation
**Evidence:** Screenshot `002_error_input_validation_empty_fields.png`

**Problem:** 
- Code attempts `int("")` without validation at `ParkingManager.py:279`
- Application crashes with technical error message instead of user-friendly guidance
- Poor user experience - no indication of required fields

**Impact:** Users encounter crashes instead of helpful validation messages

### 2. Inheritance Bugs  
**Evidence:** Code analysis of `ElectricVehicle.py`

**Problem:**
- `ElectricCar` and `ElectricBike` classes don't properly inherit from `ElectricVehicle`
- Missing `ElectricVehicle(Vehicle)` inheritance chain
- Results in `TypeError` when trying to use EV functionality

**Impact:** Electric vehicle functionality is completely broken

### 3. Poor Error Handling
**Evidence:** Various error messages throughout application

**Problem:**
- Technical stack traces shown to end users
- No graceful error recovery
- Misleading messages like "parking lot full" when lot is empty

**Impact:** Confusing user experience and difficult debugging

### 4. God Class Anti-Pattern
**Evidence:** `ParkingManager.py` (400+ lines)

**Problem:**
- Single class handles GUI, business logic, data management, and vehicle operations
- Violates Single Responsibility Principle
- Difficult to test, maintain, and extend

**Impact:** Poor code organization and scalability limitations

### Test Results:
- ✅ Parking lot creation: WORKS with valid inputs
- ⚠️ Vehicle parking: TO BE TESTED
- ⚠️ EV functionality: LIKELY BROKEN due to inheritance
